Apache intro :

It is a free and open-source cross-platform web server software, released under the terms of Apache License 2.0.



Restart Apache :

Even if Apache is running, it can be useful to restart the server. 
This will let you read the Apache startup message. If you get an error, you can use the text of the error in an online search to help you find more details and solutions. Restarting the server may produce several seconds of downtime.

# /etc/init.d/httpd restart

# /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

#  /etc/rc.d/httpd restart

Reload Apache :
Restarting or reloading Apache is also useful if you’ve recently made changes to your server, but they don’t seem to be taking effect. This is true for changes made directly in the Apache configuration files, as well as for changes you’ve made to the configuration for a dynamic language like mod_python, mod_rails (for example, Phusion Passenger, or mod_rack), mod_ruby, etc. These interfaces cache code internally, and do not reread scripts on new requests.

Reloading makes Apache reread its configuration files and incorporate the changes without a full restart, which avoids web server downtime. To reload Apache’s configuration, run the following command:

Debian and Ubuntu:

# /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Fedora and CentOS:

# /etc/init.d/httpd reload

Check the Logs :
The best place to check for Apache errors is the Apache error logs. 
To view the error logs, we recommend using the tail command with the -f flag, which shows you the most recent part of the log live as it’s updated.

Example:

# tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log

The default error log locations are:

Debian and Ubuntu:# /var/log/apache2/error.log

Fedora and CentOS:# /var/log/httpd/error_log

The access logs can also help you find specific information about visitors to your server. The default access log locations are:

Debian and Ubuntu: /var/log/apache2/access.log

Fedora and CentOS: /var/log/httpd/access_log
